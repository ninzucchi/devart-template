## Description

Occlusion explores the psychological sideeffects of pervasive technology through a series of immersive experiences :

### Subtract
     cause - Technology has introduced environmental noise, pulling our attention in multiple competing directions
     ailment - Direct conversational intimacy is extremely difficult to achieve
     solution - Slowly erase background distractions to focus full attention on the human connection
     effect - Prolonged moments of intimate social connections
     palette - Warm

### Substitute
     cause - Technology is designed to demand focus, projecting its users into isolated micro-realities 
     ailment - Users’ behaviors, postures, facial expressions convey a sense of isolation to onlookers
     solution - Blend faces toward a familiar average to erase differences and emphasize our fundamental sameness
     effect - Empathic glimpses into the fundamental unity of all men
     palette - Warm

### Slow
     cause - Technology has trained us to greedily await the future rewards of new updates and transmissions
     ailment - An accelerated perception of time creates impatience and frenetic unfocus
     solution - Slow time in moments of stillness to focus on the natural beauty of each passing frame 
     effect - Impress a bias toward patient, detail-oriented contemplation
     palette - Neutral
