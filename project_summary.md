## Description

Occlusion explores the psychological sideeffects of pervasive technology through a series of immersive experiences :

### Subtract
	Technology has introduced environmental noise, pulling our attention in multiple competing directions. This means direct conversational intimacy is extremely difficult to achieve. Subtract slowly erases background distractions to focus full attention on the human connection, creating prolonged moments of intimate social contact.

### Substitute
	Technology is designed to demand focus, projecting its users into isolated micro-realities. This means users’ behaviors, postures, facial expressions convey a sense of isolation to onlookers. Substitute blends faces toward a familiar average to erase differences and emphasize our fundamental sameness, giving empathic glimpses into our fundamental unity.

### Slow
    Technology has trained us to greedily await the future rewards of new updates and transmissions, creating an accelerated perception of time that creates impatience and frenetic unfocus. Slow slows time in moments of stillness to focus on the natural beauty of each passing frame, impressing a bias toward patient, detail-oriented contemplation.
